# A search engine and review tool for restaurants in Amsterdam

A self-initiated React app for people to search and review restaurants in Amsterdam.

This app is to learn how to use front-end frameworks [React.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) with the RESTful API for Google map.

## Key functions
1. Ability to create an account with a picture, username and location
2. Use Google Maps to let a user search a specific restaurant, either (a) through searching a location on the map or (b) through typing in a name and choosing from a list in a search box
3. Allow the user to write a review
4. Allow the user to add pictures to the review
5. Allow user to rate a specific restaurant on 1-5 scales based on specific topics
6. Responsive design down to mobile

## Steps to be taken
These are the steps I plan to work on this app:
1. Set up a Github project board to keep track of the development progress
2. Draw wireframes, sketch out how users navigate
3. Plan data models, database structure by understanding the impacts of user interaction
4. Create seed data
5. Set up authentication in the back-end
6. Set up a front-end for signing up, in, out and read data from the back-end
7. Tie front-end & back-end together by making buttons, URLs
8. Styling with the latest [material-ui@next](https://material-ui-next.com/)

## Work-in-progress
